a) My approach was to use vectors, iterators, and maps to implement the breadth
first print. My main function shows G1 and G1 and demonstrates no duplicate vertices
can be created.

b) O(|V| + |E|) where |V| = # of vertices |E| = # of edges.
best case: O(1) worst case: O(n^2) O(|V^2|)

c) a UI could be added for smoother implementation of the undigraph.
